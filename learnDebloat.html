      <h2>What is Debloating?</h2>
      <p>
        A normal Windows 11/10 contains many preinstalled software, features, or
        services, often called bloat, which over time slows and clutters the
        system, using resources unnecessarily in the backgound or foreground and
        may even pose security and privacy threats to the system. The goal of
        debloating is to remove the unnecessary preinstalled software, features,
        or services in order to free up disk space, resources, and potentially
        improve system performance, privacy, and security.
      </p>

      <h3>How to Debloat?</h3>
      <p>
        It is important to be cautious when performing a debloat on one’s
        system, as doing so carelessly might break one’s system.

      <p>
        The second tool recommended is the O&O ShutUp10++, a free antispy tool
        for Windows 10 and 11.
      </p>
      <p>
        O&O ShutUp10++ means you have full control over which comfort functions
        under Windows 10 and Windows 11 you wish to use, and you decide when the
        passing on of your data goes too far.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using a very simple interface, you decide how Windows 10 and Windows 11
        should respect your privacy by deciding which unwanted functions should
        be deactivated.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>More control over your operating system</li>
        <li>Disable Windows Copilot+ Recall</li>
        <li>Adapt your security settings</li>
        <li>Protect your privacy</li>
        <li>Control location services</li>
        <li>Disable telemetry for Microsoft Office</li>
        <li>Do not pass on your user data and diagnostics</li>
      </ul>
