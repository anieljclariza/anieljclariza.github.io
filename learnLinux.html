      <h2>What is Linux?</h2>

      <p>
        GNU/Linux, or simply Linux, is a family of open source Unix-like
        operating systems based on the Linux Kernel. Linux is typically packaged
        as a Linux distribution(distro) which includes the kernel and supporting
        system software and libraries -most of which are provided by third
        parties- to create a complete operating system. Therefore one can see
        Linux as just a kernel, while a Linux Distro is a collection of system
        software and libraries using the Linux kernel to make a complete
        operating system. Like Windows and MacOS, Linux can be used as a desktop
        operating system, although it can also be installed on specific machines
        such as servers, mainframes, and embedded systems. There are many Linux
        distributions that exist, most of which are based directly or indirectly
        on other distributions such as Debian, Fedora Linux, Linux Mint, Arch
        Linux, and Ubuntu.

        experience. Here are some recommended Linux distros to install:
      </p>

      <h3>1. Linux Mint</h3>
      <p>
        Arguably the most beginner-friendly Linux Distribution to install, Linux
        Mint is an operating system for desktop and laptop computers. It is
        designed to work ‘out of the box’ and comes fully equipped with the apps
        most people need.
