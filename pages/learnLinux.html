      <h2>What is Linux?</h2>

      <p>
        GNU/Linux, or simply Linux, is a family of open source Unix-like
        operating systems based on the Linux Kernel. Linux is typically packaged
        as a Linux distribution(distro) which includes the kernel and supporting
        system software and libraries -most of which are provided by third
        parties- to create a complete operating system. Therefore one can see
        Linux as just a kernel, while a Linux Distro is a collection of system
        software and libraries using the Linux kernel to make a complete
        operating system. Like Windows and MacOS, Linux can be used as a desktop
        operating system, although it can also be installed on specific machines
        such as servers, mainframes, and embedded systems. There are many Linux
        distributions that exist, most of which are based directly or indirectly
        on other distributions such as Debian, Fedora Linux, Linux Mint, Arch
        Linux, and Ubuntu.

        Installing a Linux Distro can provide a refreshing and knowledgeable
        experience. Here are some recommended Linux distros to install:
      </p>

      <h3>1. Linux Mint</h3>
      <p>
        Arguably the most beginner-friendly Linux Distribution to install, Linux
        Mint is an operating system for desktop and laptop computers. It is
        designed to work ‘out of the box’ and comes fully equipped with the apps
        most people need.
      </p>
      <p>

      <h3>2. Fedora Linux</h3>
      <p>
        Fedora Linux comes in many forms, but the Fedora Workstation is a
        polished, easy to use operating system for laptop and desktop computers,
        with a complete set of tools for developers and makers of all kinds.

        Installing Linux can be a fun and rewarding experience for those looking
        for a fresh start in their operating system journey. Whether you want

      <h2>What is Debloating?</h2>
      <p>
        A normal Windows 11/10 contains many preinstalled software, features, or
        services, often called bloat, which over time slows and clutters the
        system, using resources unnecessarily in the backgound or foreground and
        may even pose security and privacy threats to the system. The goal of
        debloating is to remove the unnecessary preinstalled software, features,
        or services in order to free up disk space, resources, and potentially
        improve system performance, privacy, and security.
      </p>

      <h3>How to Debloat?</h3>
      <p>
        It is important to be cautious when performing a debloat on one’s
        system, as doing so carelessly might break one’s system.
      </p>

        The first tool recommended is the UnattendWinstall from the memtechtips
        github repository. UnattendedWinstall leverages Microsoft's Answer Files

      The second tool recommended is the O&O ShutUp10++, a free antispy tool for
      Windows 10 and 11.
    </p>
    <p>
      O&O ShutUp10++ means you have full control over which comfort functions
      under Windows 10 and Windows 11 you wish to use, and you decide when the
      passing on of your data goes too far.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using a very simple interface, you decide how Windows 10 and Windows 11
      should respect your privacy by deciding which unwanted functions should be
      deactivated.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>More control over your operating system</li>
      <li>Disable Windows Copilot+ Recall</li>
